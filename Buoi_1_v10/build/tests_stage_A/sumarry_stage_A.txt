Stage A - Summary of Tasks Completed
=====================================

✅ Project Structure and Setup
-----------------------------
- Organized folders: include/, src/, tests/tests_stage_A/, build/tests_stage_A/
- Confirmed VSCode and task/launch configuration working with external console
- Standardized build & test flow using bash scripts and PowerShell automation

✅ Struct Size & Memory Testing
------------------------------
- Created test1.c to test sizes of all main structs
- test2.c: Measured size of User struct
- test3.c: Measured size of Book struct
- test4.c: Measured size of Transaction struct
- test5.c: Measured size of Event struct (timeline)
- test6.c: Measured size of Library struct (RAM usage)
- Verified total memory usage ~5.7KB fits into STM32F103C8T6 SRAM

✅ Safe Transaction Creation
----------------------------
- test7.c: Created transaction WITHOUT malloc (safe for embedded systems)
- test8.c: Demonstrated risks of using malloc on STM32 (heap zone)
- Included diagrams to visualize memory layout with and without heap

✅ Timeline Event Logging
-------------------------
- Implemented timeline_add_event() and timeline_print_all_events()
- Logged all actions (BOOK_CREATE, USER_CREATE, TRANSACTION_CREATE)
- Ensured consistent formatting for embedded-safe printing

✅ Refactoring & Documentation
------------------------------
- Cleaned up unused macros in definitions.h
- Added comments to all .c and .h files for better understanding
- Split responsibilities across book.c, user.c, transaction.c, timeline.c
- Validated include dependencies to avoid circular declarations

✅ Final Integration & Copy
----------------------------
- Moved all .c, .h, and test files into build/tests_stage_A/ for archiving
- Prepared foundation for transitioning into Stage B
